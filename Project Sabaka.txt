This progect is about a dog.
The dog was running
Around the street.
It was a rainy day
And a shivering cold gets the dog
Even to the bones.
Then a man has come up to the dog.
What's yuor name pretty one?
I am Spike - the dog said
Do you want something to eat? The man asked
Perhaps a Thanksgiving turkey, if you have one
I am a magician, so here you are.
Have a pleasure with your meal
Do you have place to stay?
Hello is anyone hearing me?
Hear you loud and clear, sir!
